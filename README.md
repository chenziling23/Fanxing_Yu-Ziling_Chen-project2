Fanxing Yu and Ziling Chen work on write up together
1. The most challenging part of this assignment is to randomize the position of the ships. Initially we set the position manually to test the functionality of the game. After we came up with the idea that we first identified the position for the head of the ship, and then used the Math.random() method to generate different random lengths of the consecutive squares and arrange them on the board, we realized the process. Beside the specific method, structuring the game also took us a lot of time. We separate the game into small components, each of the components achieve single functionality and are utilized by calling the method.
2. Given more time, we would like to add a feature that allows users to drag and place the position by themselves to make this game more interactive and vivid. Besides, we also would like to record success hit rate for players and display on the left. Also, we want to improve AI intelligence to make the game more interesting. 
3. We discussed the general structure at first and both worked on the coding part. We split the code part into small components and debug together. 
4. We spent 1 week to complete this assignment.

Additionally, in our design, we use red check marks as successful hits opponents’ ships, while red X represents miss.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
